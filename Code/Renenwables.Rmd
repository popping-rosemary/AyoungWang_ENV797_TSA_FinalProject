## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)  
library(Kendall)
library(tseries)
library(outliers)
library(tidyverse)
library(smooth)
library(zoo)
library(kableExtra)
library(cowplot)
```

```{r data file}
renewable_data <- read.csv(
  file="./Data/IEA_MonthlyElectricityProduction_1224.csv",
  header=TRUE,
  skip=8) %>% 
  filter(Country=="Germany") %>% 
  filter(Product == "Total Renewables (Hydro, Geo, Solar, Wind, Other)") %>% 
  mutate(Time = my(Time) ) %>% 
  arrange(Time) %>% 
  filter(Time>="2010-01-01")

ng_data <- read.csv(
  file="./Data/IEA_MonthlyElectricityProduction_1224.csv",
  header=TRUE,
  skip=8) %>% 
  filter(Country=="Germany") %>% 
  filter(Product == "Natural Gas") %>% 
  mutate(Time = my(Time) ) %>% 
  arrange(Time) %>% 
  filter(Time>="2010-01-01")

summary(renewable_data)
```

## Import data file 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r , echo=FALSE}
renewable_ts <- msts(renewable_data$Value, start = c(2010,1), seasonal.periods = c(12))
ng_ts <- msts(ng_data$Value, start = c(2010,1), seasonal.periods = c(12))

#check stationarity
adf.test(renewable_ts)
adf.test(ng_ts)
```

p-value < 0.05. The time series is stationary. 

## Initial Plots

```{r, message=FALSE, Warning=FALSE}
ts_plot <- 
  autoplot(renewable_ts, series = "Renewables", aes(color=group)) +
      autolayer(ng_ts, series= "Natural Gas")+
      theme_minimal()+
      ggtitle("Total Renewables vs. Natural Gas Monthly Net Generation, 2010-2024")+
      ylab("Net Generation")+
      xlab("Year")
plot(ts_plot)

#ACF and PACF plots
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
ACF_re_plot <- Acf(renewable_ts, lag = 40, plot = TRUE,main="ACF RE")
PACF_re_plot <- Pacf(renewable_ts, lag = 40, plot = TRUE,main="PACF RE")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

#ACF and PACF plots
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
ACF_ng_plot <- Acf(ng_ts, lag = 40, plot = TRUE,main="ACF NG")
PACF_ng_plot <- Pacf(ng_ts, lag = 40, plot = TRUE,main="PACF NG")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

## Check Seasonality

```{r}
# STL decomposition (Seasonal-Trend-Residual)
renewable_stl <- stl(renewable_ts, s.window = "periodic")
autoplot(renewable_stl) +
  ggtitle("STL Decomposition - Renewables")+
  theme_minimal()

ng_stl <- stl(ng_ts, s.window = "periodic")
autoplot(ng_stl) +
  ggtitle("STL Decomposition - NG")+
  theme_minimal()

# Seasonal strength test (using STL components)
season_strength_RE <- 1 - (var(renewable_stl$time.series[, "remainder"]) /
                        var(renewable_stl$time.series[, "remainder"] +
                            renewable_stl$time.series[, "seasonal"]))
cat("Estimated Seasonal Strength for Renewables:", round(season_strength_RE, 3), "\n")

season_strength_NG <- 1 - (var(ng_stl$time.series[, "remainder"]) /
                        var(ng_stl$time.series[, "remainder"] +
                            ng_stl$time.series[, "seasonal"]))
cat("Estimated Seasonal Strength for Natural Gas:", round(season_strength_NG, 3), "\n")
```

### Create subsets for training/testing 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#create a subset for training purpose
n_for = 12
ts_renewable_train <- subset(renewable_ts,
                                   end = length(renewable_ts)-n_for)

#create a subset for testing purpose
ts_renewable_test <- subset(renewable_ts,
                                   start = length(renewable_ts)-n_for)

#create a subset for displaying purpose
ts_renewable_2015 <- subset(renewable_ts,
                                   start = length(renewable_ts)-120)

autoplot(ts_renewable_train)
autoplot(ts_renewable_test)
```

## ARIMA

```{r}
ARIMA_autofit <- auto.arima(ts_renewable_train)
print(SARIMA_autofit)

ARIMA_forecast <- forecast(object = ARIMA_autofit, h = 12)

autoplot(renewable_ts) +
  autolayer(ARIMA_forecast, series="ARIMA",PI=FALSE) +
  ylab("Generation")+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("ARIMA - RE")
```

### Model 1: STL + ETS

```{r ETS, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.dim=(4,6)}
#Fit and forecast STL + ETS model to data
ETS_fit <-  stlf(ts_renewable_train,h=12)

#Plot foresting results

#alternative coding if you don't need to save the objects
#ts_act_power_daily_train %>% stlf(h=365) %>% autoplot() 
#very easy to read/run/implement 
#but you don't have anything stored on your environment

```


### Model 2: ARIMA + FOURIER terms

Since we have multiple seasonalities, the SARIMA model will not work.
But we can work with an ARIMA model with Fourier terms for each seasonal period.
This models is known as a dynamic harmonic regression model with an ARMA error structure.
We will use a log transformation (`lambda=0`) in the `auto.arima()` to ensure the forecasts and prediction intervals remain positive.
And for the fourier terms we will use function `fourier()` from package `forecast`.
The number of fourier terms needed is specified in argument `K=`.
K should be a vector of integers specifying the number of sine and cosine terms for each of the seasonal periods.
Ideally K is chosen to minimize the AICc, but we will not go over it.

Fourier terms are used to model the seasonal components.
It resembles the seasonal dummies we used in previous modules, but they are based on trigonometric functions.
More info on fourier terms [here](https://otexts.com/fpp2/useful-predictors.html#useful-predictors).

```{r ARIMA, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Fit arima model with fourier terms as exogenous regressors
# seasonal = FALSE is the same as P=D=Q=0
# play with K by changing it to K=c(2,2), K=c(2,4), K=c(2,6), etc. The higher teh K the longer it will take to converge, because R will try more models.

ARIMA_Four_fit <- auto.arima(ts_renewable_train, 
                             seasonal=FALSE, 
                             lambda=0,
                             xreg=fourier(ts_renewable_train, 
                                          K=c(6))
                             )

#Forecast with ARIMA fit
#also need to specify h for fourier terms
ARIMA_Four_for <- forecast(ARIMA_Four_fit,
                           xreg=fourier(ts_renewable_train,
                                        K=c(6),
                                        h=12),
                           h=12
                           ) 

#Plot foresting results
autoplot(ARIMA_Four_for) + ylab("Generation")

#Plot model + observed data
autoplot(renewable_ts) +
  autolayer(ARIMA_Four_for, series="ARIMA_FOURIER",PI=FALSE) +
  ylab("Generation")

#Plot combined results
autoplot(ts_renewable_2015) +
  autolayer(ARIMA_Four_for, series="ARIMA_FOURIER")+
  autolayer(ts_renewable_test, series="observed", PI=FALSE, color="black")+
  ylab("Generation") + 
  ylim(10000,33000)+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("ARIMA_FOURIER - Renewables")

```

### Model 3: TBATS

BATS is Exponential smoothing state space model with **B**ox-Cox transformation, **A**RMA errors, **T**rend and **S**easonal components.
TBATS is a trigonometric seasonal variation of BATS.
A Box Cox transformation is a transformation of non-normal dependent variables into a normal shape.

More info on BATS and TBATS with corresponding equations [here](https://forecasters.org/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/7-2a51b93047891f1ec3608bdbd77ca58d/2014/06/BlaconÃ¡_MT_ISF2014.pdf.pdf).

```{r TBATS, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.dim=(4,6)}
# TBATS can take time to fit
TBATS_fit <- tbats(ts_renewable_train)

TBATS_for <- forecast(TBATS_fit, h=12)

#Plot foresting results
autoplot(TBATS_for) +
  ylab("Generation") 

#Plot model + observed data
autoplot(renewable_ts) +
  autolayer(TBATS_for, series="TBATS",PI=FALSE)+
  ylab("Generation") 

#Plot combined results
autoplot(ts_renewable_2015) +
  autolayer(TBATS_for, series="TBATS")+
  autolayer(ts_renewable_test, series="observed", color="black")+
  ylab("Generation") + 
  ylim(10000,33000)+

```

### Model 4: Neural Network Time Series Forecasts

There is a function in package `forecast` called `nnetar()` that will fit a feed-forward neural networks model to a time series.

A feed-forward neural network is fitted with lagged values of the series as inputs.
The inputs are for lags 1 to p, and lags s to sP where `s=frequency(y)`.
If xreg is provided, its columns are also used as inputs.
The network is trained for one-step forecasting.
Multi-step forecasts are computed recursively.

For non-seasonal data, the fitted model is denoted as an NNAR(p,k) model, where k is the number of hidden nodes.
This is analogous to an AR(p) model but with nonlinear functions.
For seasonal data, the fitted model is called an NNAR(p,P,k)[m] model, which is analogous to an ARIMA(p,0,0)(P,0,0)[s] model but with nonlinear functions.

```{r NNETAR, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.dim=(4.6)}
#You can play with the different values for p and P, you can also use xreg with Fourier term to model the multiple seasonality

#NN_fit <- nnetar(ts_act_power_daily_train,p=1,P=1)
NN_fit <- nnetar(ts_renewable_train,
                 p=1,
                 P=1,
                 xreg=fourier(ts_renewable_train, K=c(2)))

#NN_for <- forecast(NN_fit, h=365) 
NN_for <- forecast(NN_fit, 
                   h=12,
                   xreg=fourier(ts_renewable_train, 
                                          K=c(2),h=12))


#Plot foresting results
autoplot(NN_for) +
  ylab("Generation") 


#Plot model + observed data
autoplot(renewable_ts) +
  autolayer(NN_for, series="Neural Network",PI=FALSE)+
  ylab("Generation") 

#Plot combined results
autoplot(ts_renewable_2015) +
  autolayer(NN_for, series="Neural Network")+
  autolayer(ts_renewable_test, series="observed", color="black")+
  ylab("Generation") + 
  ylim(10000,33000)+
  theme_minimal()+
  ggtitle("NN - Renewables")

```

## Checking accuracy of the fo models

```{r}

#Model 1: STL + ETS
ETS_scores <- accuracy(ETS_fit$mean,ts_renewable_test)  

#Model 2: ARIMA + Fourier 
ARIMA_scores <- accuracy(ARIMA_Four_for$mean,ts_renewable_test)

# Model 3:  TBATS 
TBATS_scores <- accuracy(TBATS_for$mean,ts_renewable_test)

# Model 4:  Neural Network 
NN_scores <- accuracy(NN_for$mean,ts_renewable_test)


```

Note that a new accuracy measure appeared in the table.
Theil's U is a relative accuracy measure that compares the forecasted results with the results of forecasting with minimal historical data.

### Compare performance metrics

Now we will create a data frame that combines performance metrics for all the three models.
You can choose one metric to help you choose among models.

```{r}
#create data frame
scores <- as.data.frame(
  rbind(ETS_scores, ARIMA_scores, TBATS_scores, NN_scores)
  )
row.names(scores) <- c("STL+ETS", "ARIMA+Fourier","TBATS","NN")

#choose model with lowest RMSE
best_model_index <- which.min(scores[,"RMSE"])
cat("The best model by RMSE is:", row.names(scores[best_model_index,]))    

kbl(scores, 
      caption = "Forecast Accuracy for Renewables Net Generation",
      digits = array(5,ncol(scores))) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", latex_options = "hold_position") %>%
  #highlight model with lowest RMSE
  kable_styling(latex_options="striped", stripe_index = which.min(scores[,"RMSE"]))
```

### Plotting everything together

Here we will use autoplot() and autolayer() from package `ggplot2` to draw a particular plot for time series.
The function autolayer() takes a few main arguments.

-   **x** Forecast object produced by forecast() function.If forecasts were generated with another function you may need to point to the object either mean or forecast to get the values.\
-   **include** number of values from time series to include in plot.Default is all values.\
-   **PI** Logical flag indicating whether to plot prediction intervals.\
-   **series** Matches an unidentified forecast layer with a colored object on the plot.

```{r}
autoplot(ts_renewable_test) +
  autolayer(ETS_fit, PI=FALSE, series="STL+ETS") +
  autolayer(ARIMA_Four_for, PI=FALSE, series="ARIMA + Fourier") +
  autolayer(TBATS_for,PI=FALSE, series="TBATS") +
  autolayer(NN_for,PI=FALSE, series="NN") +
  ylab("Daily Active Power") +
  guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Forecast"))
```
## Final Forecast

```{r TBATS, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# TBATS can take time to fit
TBATS_fit_final <- tbats(renewable_ts)

TBATS_for_2025 <- forecast(TBATS_fit_final, h=12)

#Plot foresting results
autoplot(TBATS_for_2025) +
  ylab("Generation") +
  ggtitle("Net Generation - Total Renewables (TBATS)")+
  theme_minimal()

#Plot model + observed data
autoplot(renewable_ts) +
  autolayer(TBATS_for_2025, series="TBATS",PI=FALSE)+
  ylab("Generation") 

for_start = as.Date("2025-01-01") 
for_end = as.Date("2025-12-01")
for_period <- format(seq(as.Date(for_start), as.Date(for_end), by = "month"), "%b %Y")

TBATS_re_df <- tibble(Time = for_period, NetGen = TBATS_for_2025$mean)
print(TBATS_re_df)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
